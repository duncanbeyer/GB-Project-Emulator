The Most recently uploaded version 8 runs on Windows. After downloading, it can be tested by opening the main project folder and running ./part roms/zelda.gb.

This emulator works for games with memory type MBC1, MBC1+RAM, and MBC1+RAM+BATTERY. More memory types, along with audio support, have not been implemented. An example of a working MBC1+RAM+BATTERY game is The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. A copy exists under the roms folder for demonstration and testing purposes.
