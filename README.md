WIP Gameboy DMG-01 Emulator

Based on tutorial series on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxiWMqQvhg_yk4qy2cSC3457wZJga_e5

V6 is a fully completed version from the tutorial.  It is functional for some Gameboy games, not all,
does not have audio yet, and only runs on linux.

The current objective is to get the most updated version working properly on Windows. Next will be 
implementing the rest of the types of Gameboy games, then audio.
