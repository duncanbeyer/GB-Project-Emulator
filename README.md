WIP Gameboy DMG-01 Emulator

Based on tutorial series on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxiWMqQvhg_yk4qy2cSC3457wZJga_e5

V6 is a fully completed version from the tutorial.  It is functional for some Gameboy games, not all,
does not have audio yet, running on linux.  The V8 version is configured to run on Windows.

The current objective is implementing audio support.
